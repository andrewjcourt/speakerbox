# speakerbox
A basic demonstration of voice synthesis using NSSpeechSynthesiser in a Tkinter GUI.

Python 2.7 and Mac OSX only.

Combines a text-entry tool designed in Tkinter with the voices of NSSS. 

Enter text in English, hit Tab to hear it read in the default voice (Alex), or click buttons in the Voices menu for other flavours.

The voice can also be entered by name anywhere in the text field between angle brackets (e.g. "<Vicki>").
